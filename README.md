Dpaste

dpaste.top is a [pastebin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pastebin) application written in [Python](https://www.python.org/) using the [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) framework. You can find a live installation on [dpaste.top](https://dpaste.top)

The project is intended to run standalone as any regular Django Project, but it's also possible to install it into an existing project as a typical Django application.


⚠️ dpaste requires at a minimum Python 3.6 and Django 3.2.
